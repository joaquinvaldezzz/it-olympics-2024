                Our Lady of Fatima University Antipolo In year 2007, a ground-breaking ceremony
                marked the beginning of the OLFU Antipolo campus to provide affordable but of
                quality education to the residents of Rizal and its nearby communities. In 2008, the
                first building –Vicente M. Santos Building– was completed and was spearheaded by
                Mrs. Racquel Braganza until year 2010. Initially there were 10 programs offered by
                the campus at that time. The campus during its first operation was nurtured by 39
                dedicated faculty members and was assisted by 17 non-teaching staff. In 2011, Engr.
                Wilfredo M. Basilio became the 2nd Campus Administrator up to the present.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2009, Juliet Santos Building (JSB), the 2nd building, was constructed to house
                the growing student population. This building has the University gym where the
                University Phoenix Basketball Team practices in preparation for the National
                Athletic Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (NAASCU) basketball
                competition.
              </p>

              <p>
                A year after (2010), another building was built –the St. John de Baptist Hall– which
                accommodated the different paramedical and computer laboratory rooms.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2011, the 6-storey St. Catherine Hall was constructed and housed the Fatima
                University Gallery (FUG) where various art exhibits are displayed and is open for
                students' viewing. The FUG is managed by Mr. Robert Bjorn O. Santos, Gallery
                Director and concurrently Director of the Alumni Affairs Office and the English
                Studies.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2016, because of continuous effort to give quality education, the campus went
                through PACUCOA Accreditation. These programs are: BS in Hotel and Restaurant
                Management, BS in Travel Management, BS in Information Technology, BS in Nursing, BS

                In year 2019, OLFU continued to widen its reach as it had stepped on to a new
                milestone – this time, in Southern Luzon.
              </p>

              <p>
                Making quality Fatimanian education even more within reach, the sixth OLFU Campus
                began its operations in what is known as the “Lion City of South Luzon” – the highly
                progressive City of Santa Rosa, Laguna.
              </p>

              <p>
                A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 20 October 2018 which formally initiated the
                construction phase. The Campus was officially inaugurated last 19 June 2019 along
                the Old National Hi-Way (Manila South Road), in Barangay Macabling, City of Santa
                Rosa. Situated just five minutes from SM City, the school opened during SY 2019-2020
                with its initial program offerings: Bachelor of Science degrees in Medical
                Laboratory Science, Pharmacy, Psychology, Computer Science and International Tourism
                Management.
              </p>

              <p>
                It has slowly added new programs through the years namely: Bachelor of Science
                degrees in Physical Therapy, Accountancy, Accounting Information System, and
                Criminology. It now also welcomes the Senior High School Students with the ABM
                (Accountancy, Business, and Management), STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
                Mathematics), HUMMs (Humanities and Social Sciences), and GAS (Generic Academic
                Strand).
              </p>

              <p>
                OLFU Sta. Rosa now sits on a four-hectare property, and the campus' first building
                stands with five stories and over 20 classrooms and laboratories. A total of five to
                six buildings are in the pipeline over the next few years.

                In pursuit of actualizing the bid to further spread its reach up to Northern Luzon,
                OLFU began to operate in Nueva Ecija when they acquired and the Nueva Ecija Doctors'
                Colleges, Inc. (NEDCI) in year 2015. Located in Maharlika Highway, Cabanatuan City,
                Nueva Ecija, the branch now serves as Fatima's fifth campus.
              </p>

              <p>
                Being established as an educational institution in 1970, NEDCI provided OLFU
                Cabanatuan Campus a fertile ground of academe experience on which OLFU immediately
                began building on through infusing its initial program offerings and widespread
                facilities upgrade. From its time of acquisition, continuous infrastructures were
                built such as: a fully air conditioned multi-purpose gym and auditorium, (the 1st in
                Region III Nueva Ecija sport Complex), 3-storey classroom, most of which are
                air-conditioned. Modern equipment for the laboratories were purchased to have a
                simulated hospital/hotel necessary for the training of their students.

              Our Lady of Fatima University-Pampanga is the only non-sectarian, privately-owned
              university at the heart of the provincial capital, the City of San Fernando.

              <p>
                With the intent to extend and actualize the mission-vision of “Improving Man as Man”
                to the Kapampangans, OLFU acquired the East Central Colleges (ECC), an educational
                institution of higher learning on the 12th of April 2012. Located on B. Mendoza
                Street, Sto. Rosario, ECC was a 67-year old educational institution known for its
                legacy of offering affordable and accessible quality education to Kapampangans and
                the nearby regions. The establishment of the Pampanga Campus ushered in the same
                high quality standard of education espoused by Our Lady Fatima University.
              </p>

              <p>
                With a modest 500 student count as a starting point in ECC, OLFU Pampanga began
                building a reputation for being a new haven for achievers in 2012. On September 19th
                of the same year, the University marked a milestone as it broke ground on a
                sprawling property on MacArthur Highway, Barangay Dela Paz Norte. As multiple,
                state-of-the-art buildings and facilities were constructed on the said site, this
                allowed OLFU Pampanga to expand its program offerings in response to the growing
                clamor from the Pampanga community. And, by July 28, 2015, the Security and Exchange
                Commission (SEC) granted the University with the registration, and with it, the
                right to replace the name of East Central Colleges with that of Our Lady of Fatima
                University-Pampanga.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the moment, OLFU Pampanga is composed of 11 Colleges in the fields of: Nursing,
                Medical Laboratory Science (MedTech), Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, Arts & Sciences,
                Business & Accountancy, Hospitality & Institutional Management, Computer Studies,
                Education, Criminal Justice and Engineering. These Colleges together present 20
                program offerings. Additionally, the University has Senior High School, Junior High
                School and Graduate School programs.

                In 1996, Our Lady of Fatima University made its presence known in Quezon City with
                its new campus along Regalado Avenue in Fairview—- the Fatima Eye and Rehabilitation
                Center Building which also housed the Physical Therapy program.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 1998, a new eight-storey building overlooking the scenic La Mesa reservoir was
                constructed. The acquired property goes back in history as the residence of the
                former Philippine President Elpidio Quirino. In its early years, several curricular
                programs were offered in the Quezon City Campus, namely: Education, Tourism,
                Business Administration, Computer Science, Information Technology, Nursing,
                Pharmacy, Medical Technology, Psychology and Biology. In addition, Basic Education
                (Elementary and High School) was also opened; housed in a brand-new, five-storey
                building.
              </p>

              <p>
                This Fatima campus, soon known as the Hilltop because of its hilly terrain,
                constructed a few more buildings in 2003 and 2005 to accommodate the rapidly-growing
                student population— an affirmation of its acceptance by the people of Quezon City.
              </p>

              <p>
                None too soon, two more buildings sprouted up along Regalado Avenue; this time,
                serving as the base for nursing laboratories, medtech laboratories, as well as the
                programs of business administration, accountancy and education.
              </p>

              <p>Today, OLFU-QC Campus is home to 10 Colleges and a robust roster of programs.</p>

              <p>
                To ensure that its program offerings are relevant and of quality standard, the
                University voluntarily submits itself to program accreditations. The Quezon City
                Campus is continuously monitored by various agencies to assess the programs’
                compliance to quality standards. These accrediting agencies are the Philippine
                Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Audit (PACUCOA) and the
                Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities (ACSCU).
              </p>

              <p>
                In June 2012, university-wide ISO implementation was put into action to further
                increase customer satisfaction, improve product quality, and achieve international
                quality recognition.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2018, the University became ISO 9001:2015 certified by the AJA Registrars. This
                prestige is evidence that OLFU’s processes and standards are at par with
                international management systems.
              </p>

              <p>
                As an accomplished and reputable Private Higher Educational Institution (PHEI) in
                the country, Our Lady of Fatima University- Quezon City nurtures a harmonious
