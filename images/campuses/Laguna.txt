Our Lady of Fatima University Laguna
In year 2019, OLFU continued to widen its reach as it had stepped on to a new milestone – this time, in Southern Luzon.

Making quality Fatimanian education even more within reach, the sixth OLFU Campus began its operations in what is known as the “Lion City of South Luzon” – the highly progressive City of Santa Rosa, Laguna.

A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 20 October 2018 which formally initiated the construction phase. The Campus was officially inaugurated last 19 June 2019 along the Old National Hi-Way (Manila South Road), in Barangay Macabling, City of Santa Rosa. Situated just five minutes from SM City, the school opened during SY 2019-2020 with its initial program offerings: Bachelor of Science degrees in Medical Laboratory Science, Pharmacy, Psychology, Computer Science and International Tourism Management.

It has slowly added new programs through the years namely: Bachelor of Science degrees in Physical Therapy, Accountancy, Accounting Information System, and Criminology. It now also welcomes the Senior High School Students with the ABM (Accountancy, Business, and Management), STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), HUMMs (Humanities and Social Sciences), and GAS (Generic Academic Strand).

OLFU Sta. Rosa now sits on a four-hectare property, and the campus’ first building stands with five stories and over 20 classrooms and laboratories. A total of five to six buildings are in the pipeline over the next few years.
