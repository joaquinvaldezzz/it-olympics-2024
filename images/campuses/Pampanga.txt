Our Lady of Fatima University Pampanga
Our Lady of Fatima University-Pampanga is the only non-sectarian, privately-owned university at the heart of the provincial capital, the City of San Fernando.

With the intent to extend and actualize the mission-vision of “Improving Man as Man” to the Kapampangans, OLFU acquired the East Central Colleges (ECC), an educational institution of higher learning on the 12th of April 2012. Located on B. Mendoza Street, Sto. Rosario, ECC was a 67-year old educational institution known for its legacy of offering affordable and accessible quality education to Kapampangans and the nearby regions. The establishment of the Pampanga Campus ushered in the same high quality standard of education espoused by Our Lady Fatima University.

With a modest 500 student count as a starting point in ECC, OLFU Pampanga began building a reputation for being a new haven for achievers in 2012. On September 19th of the same year, the University marked a milestone as it broke ground on a sprawling property on MacArthur Highway, Barangay Dela Paz Norte. As multiple, state-of-the-art buildings and facilities were constructed on the said site, this allowed OLFU Pampanga to expand its program offerings in response to the growing clamor from the Pampanga community. And, by July 28, 2015, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted the University with the registration, and with it, the right to replace the name of East Central Colleges with that of Our Lady of Fatima University-Pampanga.

At the moment, OLFU Pampanga is composed of 11 Colleges in the fields of: Nursing, Medical Laboratory Science (MedTech), Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, Arts & Sciences, Business & Accountancy, Hospitality & Institutional Management, Computer Studies, Education, Criminal Justice and Engineering. These Colleges together present 20 program offerings. Additionally, the University has Senior High School, Junior High School and Graduate School programs.
